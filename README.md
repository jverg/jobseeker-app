# Jobseeker App
This is a jobseeker app for testing purposes.

# General information about the project
This project is for testing purposes in Kariera.gr company.

Î™nstructions that gave it to me:
* Figma designs that can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/1gxyhj9cuyXrVKYDvNVvMS/Frontend-challenge?node-id=1%3A3&t=hwe4nBqv9QWRWB7D-0)
* Figma preview that can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/1gxyhj9cuyXrVKYDvNVvMS/Frontend-challenge?node-id=24%3A0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=1%3A3&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2)
* One API project with all endpoints that can be found [here](https://ka-fe-assignment.azurewebsites.net/api/docs/)

The decisions I made deserve to be noted:
* I copied funcionality from project that I have worked in the past (This may be my fault)
* I used nextjs: 12v because I have not seen nextjs: 13v and I. do not believe I have the time to go with nextjs: 13v. I also bbelieve that Nextjs 13 isn't stable for production yet, it has parts that the community believes it also.
* I used nvm(Node Version Manager) with node 16

Problems that I didn't have time to solve:
* Some warnings that has the project on build(I believee they have to do with modules version)
* I didn't have time to do the react-intersection-observer mock in test so the JobsList component has no tests

# Steps to start the project
```
 Install node v16.19.0
 
 nvm use 16
 
 yarn install
 
 yarn dev
```
* Copy the **.env.example** file to **.env** file and update the giver variables
* You have to go on **localhost:3000/login** to see the login page of the app

# Action points that I have to mention

PS: For some UI functionalities, I had to make some decisions by myself.

PS2: I really enjoyed this whole trip I did, till this project.

I want to thank George and Panagiotis  for their leadership and their time they devoted to me.

PS3: After this project I found that we have so many things to change on our HRprior production project
